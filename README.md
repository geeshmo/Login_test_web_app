# Login_test_web_app
Created with CodeSandbox

This is a test file to beging my react journey:
This takes two apps a login app and a basic statix box app and tries to combine them
there is a login page, signup page, 
app page: original landing page with sign out button
app2 page: static page where button has been added after static

the idea being the login --> app2(button)--> app (button) --> login
